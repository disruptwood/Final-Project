# Critical Review & Improvement Plan

## Critique of Current Draft

### Slide 3: Research Question
*   **Current**: "Can a platform based on verified traits... overcome the 'Trust & Relevance Gap'?"
*   **Critique**: This is a *leading question*. It assumes the solution (verification) before presenting the research that justifies it. It sounds like a pitch, not a research project.
*   **Honest Question**: Why did I choose this? Because I wanted to get to the "Verified Circles" idea quickly.
*   **Improvement**: Start with an explorative question: "Why do adults with high intent to make friends fail to do so on existing platforms?"

### Slide 5: Competitor Analysis
*   **Current**: General complaints ("Thirst traps", "Flakes").
*   **Critique**: Is this rigorous? It feels anecdotal.
*   **Missing**: A structured feature gap analysis. Do Bumble/Meetup *have* verification? If so, why doesn't it work? (e.g., Bumble has photo verification, but not *trait* verification).
*   **Improvement**: Distinguish between "Identity Verification" (Bot protection) vs "Trait Verification" (Quality/Relevance assurance).

### Slide 7: User Insights
*   **Current**: "Netnography" summary.
*   **Critique**: It's a bit thin. Did we actually "hear" users say they want *verified* friends? Or did they just say they hate flakes?
*   **Intermediate Step**: We need to link "Flakiness" to "Low Social Cost" and "Low Trust". The solution to flakiness is increasing "Skin in the game" (Verification).

## Plan for Improvement

1.  **Refine the Narrative Arc**:
    *   **Phase 1 (Discover)**: Problem = Loneliness. Question = Why do current tools fail?
    *   **Phase 2 (Define)**: Findings = The "Trust & Relevance Gap".
    *   **Phase 3 (Develop)**: Hypothesis = Verification acts as a proxy for trust.
    *   **Phase 4 (Deliver)**: Solution = Verified Circles.

2.  **Additional Research Needed**:
    *   **Competitors**: Check specifically what verification they offer. (Bumble Photo Verification vs LinkedIn verification).
    *   **Theory**: "Signaling Theory" - how costly signals (verification) increase trust.

3.  **Presentation Update**:
    *   Rewrite slides to follow this logical discovery process.
    *   Append the "Critical Reflection" notes to each slide as requested.
