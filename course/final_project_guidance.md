# Project Steps

1. **Select a Topic:**  
   Choose one of the provided customer/user problems to focus on (see Appendix). Each group will have a unique topic, so coordinate with your peers.

2. **Plan Your Research:**  
   Break your research into phases: market research, competitor analysis, and customer/user research. Create a timeline for each phase to ensure you stay on track.

   * Research plan: Research goals, research questions, target audience, research methods.  
3. **Market Research:**  
   Understand the industry and market trends related to your product idea. Analyze the size of the market, growth potential, and any external factors influencing the domain.

4. **Competitive Analysis:**  
   Identify direct and indirect competitors. Compare their strengths, weaknesses, and unique selling propositions. Understand their pricing, positioning, and customer base.

5. **Customer and User Research:**  
   Define your target audience. Create personas based on demographics, behaviors, and needs. Use qualitative and quantitative methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, focus groups, observational research). We recommend conducting at least 3 user/expert interviews & a thematic coding.

6. **Synthesize Findings:**  
   Identify the key insights and patterns from your research. Develop actionable conclusions that could guide product design and strategy. If you find that the original problem wasn’t well defined or wasn’t the main problem of the audience, you can redefine the problem that you believe you need to address.

7. **Prepare Your Presentation:**

   Structure your presentation into:

   * Problem statement and topic overview.

   * Target audience and personas.  
   * Summary of research methods and tools used.  
   * Key findings for market, competitors, and customers/users.  
   * Interviews- how many and who (type of persons) you interviewed, summary of thematic coding, quotes.   
   * Conclusion and recommendations for product strategy.

   Use visuals like competitors charts, personas, unique value proposition, thematic coding summary, and frameworks to communicate your findings effectively. 

   Think about your storytelling and how you present your product strategy by presenting all the research you did and how you validated each decision based on the data.
