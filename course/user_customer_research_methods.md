Persona
●
A persona is a ﬁctional, yet realistic, description of a typical or target
user of the product. A persona is an archetype instead of an actual living
human, but personas should be described as if they were real people.
●
Personas can humanize complex data and help give UX design teams a
consistent focus and design target
●
Persona fosters empathy for the speciﬁc users we are designing for, and
helps us break away from the attempt to design for everyone

About the Challenge
Your AI-Powered Companion for Emotional Wellness
●
Research and design a prototype for a mobile app that includes Angel’s conversational bot (AI
agent) that helps the user to describe its pains and needs based on the current mental crisis
the user is experiencing - anxiety, depression, grief etc, caused by diﬀerent reason (as a war,
divorce, stress at work etc), and provides them with immediate support and tailors the user a
well-being personalized plan for crisis management and growth.
●
The conversational AI agent needs to not only understand the user's current mental/emotional
status and situation but also to assess it and suggest various solutions to support the current
well-being and the long-term user's healing and coping goals.
