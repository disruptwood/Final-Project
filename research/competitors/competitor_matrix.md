# Competitor Feature Matrix (B2C framing)

**Goal**: compare *mechanisms*, not opinions — how do solutions address trust + “don’t-go-alone” + follow-through?

| Product type | Example | Trust / Safety mechanism | “Don’t go alone” structure | Personal relevance | Pricing model (rough) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Open matching | Bumble For Friends | Photo verification (optional), moderation | None (user coordinates 1:1) | Mostly profile + swiping | Freemium |
| Open events | Meetup | Organizer rules vary; public group history | Partial (events exist, but you can still arrive alone) | Topic/activity tags (broad) | Free for users; organizer subscription |
| Curated events | Timeleft | Curated small groups in public venues | Yes (the experience is “go with a group”) | Limited personalization | Ticket / subscription |
| Our concept | Verified Circles | Light verification options + clear rules + reporting | Yes (buddy or micro-group for first events) | Circles by city + context (repeatable) | Paid events → membership later |

## Why this matters for our survey findings
Our survey indicates:
- People often go alone **or** avoid the activity entirely (`research/surveys/survey1_summary.md`).
- Safety/trust signals (verified profile, video call, mutual friends) are concrete and repeat in open responses.

So the gap we target is: **make it feel safe + structured to attend the first time** *and* keep relevance through repeatable circles (not just one-off dinners).
