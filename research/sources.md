# Sources & Data References (Used/Usable in the Deck)

This project mixes:
- **Primary data** (our survey CSV)
- **Secondary sources** (public reports, official competitor pages)
- **Academic framing** (to explain mechanisms, not to “prove” a product)

## 1) Primary data (our work)
- **User survey raw export (N=45)**: `research/surveys/survey_responses_raw.csv`
- **Survey summary (cleaned + computed)**: `research/surveys/survey1_summary.md`

## 2) Competitor scan (official / pricing pages)
The verified pricing/coverage table lives here:
- `research/data/competitor_pricing.csv`

Key sources referenced from that table (examples):
- Meetup organizer pricing: https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/28677808413197-Organizer-Subscription-prices-overview
- Timeleft pricing / subscription: https://help.timeleft.com/en/articles/8871853-what-budget-can-i-expect

## 3) Problem context (public sources)
We only use these as *context*, not as “our survey replacement”:
- Youth loneliness in Europe (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2024): https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/en/our-projects/next-generation-and-society/project-news/a-comparison-of-youth-loneliness-in-europe-in-2024
