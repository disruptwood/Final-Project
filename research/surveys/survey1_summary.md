# Survey 1 Results (Real Data) — “Friends & New Connections”

**Raw data**: `research/surveys/survey_responses_raw.csv` (Google Forms export)  
**N**: 45 responses  
**Note**: The export contains duplicated columns; analysis consolidates each question by taking the first non-empty answer across the duplicates.

## What we can say confidently from this survey

### 1) The “go alone vs. give up” behavior is common
**Question**: “When you want to do an activity (e.g., running/tennis) and have no partner, what do you usually do?”
- **Go alone**: 24/45 (53%)
- **Give up** (“מוותר”): 8/45 (18%)
- **Don’t do such activities**: 8/45 (18%)
- **Search in WhatsApp/FB groups**: 3/45 (7%)
- **Other**: 2/45 (4%)

**Implication**: The core pain is not just “discovering people” — it’s reducing the *social risk* enough to make people show up *with someone*.

### 2) Many find it hard to attend alone
**Question**: “How hard is it for you to go to a social event/activity when you don’t know anyone there?” (1–5)
- Average: **3.27/5**
- **4–5 (hard/very hard)**: 18/45 (40%)

### 3) Dating apps are not used as a substitute for social connection
**Question** (yes/no variant): “Have you used dating apps (Tinder/Bumble) just for social interaction/chat, not necessarily for a date?”
- **No**: 43/44 (98%) of those who answered

### 4) Safety/trust signals are concrete (open responses)
In the open-ended “what made you feel safe enough to meet?” answers, recurring signals include:
- **Video/phone call** (“דיברנו קודם בטלפון/וידאו”)
- **Profile looks real/detailed** (“הפרופיל שלו נראה אמיתי ומפורט”)
- **Mutual friends** (“ראיתי שיש לנו חברים משותפים…”)

## Limitations (important for the deck)
- Self-selected sample; not representative.
- Some questions are open-ended; we can describe patterns but should avoid “precise %” claims unless we code systematically.
