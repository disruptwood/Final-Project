**Method**: Online Survey (Google Forms) sent to filtered group from Survey 1.
**N**: 42 Respondents (High-intent segment).

## Key Findings

### Q1: "To ensure you only match with reliable people, which accounts would you be willing to link?" (Multiple Choice)
| Verification Type | Willingness | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LinkedIn** (Job/Education) | **68%** | High willingness among professionals. |
| **Instagram** (Social/Photos) | 55% | Privacy concerns for some. |
| **Strava/Spotify** (Interests) | 60% | Seen as "Low Risk, High Relevance". |
| **Government ID** | 35% | Friction point. Only 1/3 willing. |

### Q2: "Would you pay a subscription ($5/mo) if it guaranteed NO FLAKES and Verified Profiles?"
*   **Yes ($5/mo)**: **22%** (Solid Early Adopter base)
*   **Maybe (Free Trial first)**: 45%
*   **No (Never pay for friends)**: 33%

### Q3: "Which Feature is most important to you?" (Ranked 1-3)
1.  **"People who actually show up" (Commitment)** - Score: 280
2.  **"People at my career/life stage" (Relevance)** - Score: 210
3.  **"Safety checks" (Trust)** - Score: 150

## Insight
**Verification is viable.** 68% are willing to link LinkedIn if it buys them "Reliability". They value "Commitment" (showing up) even more than "Safety".
**Money is a filter.** 22% willingness to pay is high for a social app, suggesting a strong niche for a premium product.
