## Part 1: Persona Summaries

| ID | Name | Role | Segment | Core Struggle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1** | **Omer** (32) | Senior Backend Dev | **Relocator** (TLV -> NYC) | "I have standards, but no access. Bumble BFF uses dating logic, which feels weird for finding tennis partners." |
| **P2** | **Sarah** (29) | Product Manager | **New Job** (Finance -> Tech) | "I switched industries and lost my 'work friends'. Everyone in the new startup is 22. I feel isolated effectively." |
| **P3** | **David** (24) | Student/Security | **Post-Military** | "In the army, brotherhood was automatic. In university, everyone is in their own bubble. I miss the 'reliable' crew." |
| **P4** | **Elena** (35) | UX Lead | **Young Parent** | "I have exactly 2 hours of free time a week. I can't afford to show up to a Meetup and find it's just people selling insurance." |
| **P5** | **Alex** (28) | Data Scientist | **Introvert** | "I'm great 1-on-1, but I freeze in large groups. Meetups are my nightmare. I need to know *who* I'm meeting first." |
| **P6** | **Maya** (31) | Marketing VP | **High-Achiever** | "I value my time at $200/hr. I want to meet peers who are ambitious, not just 'anyone looking for a friend'." |

## Part 2: Interview Transcripts (Simulated)

### Interview P1: Omer (The Relocator)
**Interviewer**: Tell me about your last attempt to find a tennis partner in NYC.
**Omer**: It was a disaster. I posted in a Facebook group "Upper West Side Tennis". Got 3 replies.
**Interviewer**: What happened?
**Omer**: First guy rescheduled 3 times. Second guy showed up but couldn't hit a ball. Third guy was actually an insurance agent trying to network.
**Interviewer**: How did that feel?
**Omer**: Frustrating. I wasted two weekends. Now I just play against the wall or pay a coach $120.
**Interviewer**: Why not use Bumble BFF?
**Omer**: I tried. But swiping on guys feels... unnatural. And you can't filter by "Level 4.0 Tennis". You just see photos. It feels like dating, which is awkard when you have a girlfriend.

### Interview P2: Sarah (The Career Switcher)
**Interviewer**: You mentioned feeling isolated after changing jobs. Can't you hang out with old colleagues?
**Sarah**: We drifted apart. They are still in Finance hours; I'm in Tech. And my new team... they go to raves. I'm 29, I like wine bars and hiking.
**Interviewer**: Have you tried Meetup.com?
**Sarah**: Yeah, I went to a "Women in Product" event.
**Interviewer**: How was it?
**Sarah**: It was okay, but huge. 100 people. I exchanged LinkedIn stats with 5 people, we said "let's grab coffee", and then... silence.
**Interviewer**: Why silence?
**Sarah**: Because there's no structure. reaching out strictly for friendship feels desperate. If there was a specific reason to meet—like "Review this portfolio"—maybe it would happen.

### Interview P3: David (Post-Military)
**Interviewer**: What's the biggest difference between your social life in the unit versus now?
**David**: Reliability. In the army, if you say "I'll be there," you are there. Here, people say "Maybe" and that means "No".
**Interviewer**: Can you give an example?
**David**: We tried to organize a study group. 10 people said "Going" on WhatsApp. 2 showed up.
**Interviewer**: How does that affect you?
**David**: I stopped trying. If I can't trust people to commit, I'd rather study alone. Trust is the baseline for me.

### Interview P4: Elena (The Time-Poor Parent)
**Interviewer**: As a new parent, what's your biggest barrier to socializing?
**Elena**: Unpredictability. I have a babysitter for Tuesday night. If I plan a dinner and the other person cancels last minute, I literally wasted my "golden ticket".
**Interviewer**: So what do you do?
**Elena**: I stick to my existing friends, even if we have nothing to talk about anymore. It's safe.
**Interviewer**: What would make you take a risk on a new person?
**Elena**: Verification. If I knew they were also a parent, or also a professional who respects calendars... basically, if they had "Social Credit" to lose by flaking.

### Interview P5: Alex (The Introvert)
**Interviewer**: You said Meetups are a nightmare. Why?
**Alex**: It's the noise. Entering a room of 50 strangers... I just stand in the corner looking at my phone.
**Interviewer**: What works better for you?
**Alex**: 1-on-1 is great. But getting there is hard.
**Interviewer**: What do you check before meeting someone 1-on-1?
**Alex**: I stalk them online. LinkedIn, Instagram. I need to know they are sane, smart, and safe.
**Interviewer**: Is that process easy?
**Alex**: No, it takes hours. And sometimes you can't find anything, so you just don't go.

### Interview P6: Maya (The High-Achiever)
**Interviewer**: Some people say seeking "ambitious friends" is elitist. What do you think?
**Maya**: It's not about status, it's about *wavelength*. I work hard. I want to talk about macro-economics, or triathlons, or startups.
**Interviewer**: Can't you find that anywhere?
**Maya**: Rarely. Most "social" events are very casual/surface level. I want "High-Density" conversations. I want a filter that says "This person is intense, like you."
**Interviewer**: Would you verify your income or job title to get access?
**Maya**: Absolutely. LinkedIn verification would be the minimum for me. It proves you are who you say you are.
