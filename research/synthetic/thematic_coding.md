# Thematic Coding: From Quotes to Insights

**Source**: 6 Synthetic Interviews (Relocators, High-Achievers, Parents).
**Method**: Inductive Coding (Quote -> Code -> Theme).

| Quote | Code | Theme | Insight | Opportunity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "First guy rescheduled 3 times... I wasted two weekends." (Omer) | Flaking / Time Waste | **The Reliability Gap** | Users fear "wasted time" more than "rejection". | Penalize flaking or reward attendance (Deposit/Karma). |
| "In the army, brotherhood was automatic... I miss the 'reliable' crew." (David) | Nostalgia for Structure | **The Reliability Gap** | "Reliability" is a core trait of deep friendship. | Highlight "Reliability" as a verified trait. |
| "I have exactly 2 hours of free time... I can't afford to show up and find it's just people selling insurance." (Elena) | Fear of Low Quality | **The Trust Filter** | User time is scarce; "Open" events feel too risky. | Curate matches to ensure high "Signal-to-Noise" ratio. |
| "I need to know they are sane, smart, and safe... I stalk them online." (Alex) | Manual Vetting | **The Trust Filter** | Users are already doing manual verification (stalking); it's just inefficient. | Automate the vetting process (LinkedIn/Social Link) to save user effort. |
| "I swiped... but seeing photos feels like dating... weird when you have a girlfriend." (Omer) | Dating App Fatigue | **Relevance Signal** | "Dating mechanics" (Photos) don't work for friendship (Shared Interest). | Remove swiping. Focus on "Stats/Interests" matching, not faces. |
| "I want to talk about macro-economics... I want a filter that says 'This person is intense, like you.'" (Maya) | Intellectual Compatibility | **Relevance Signal** | "interests" (e.g., Tennis) are not enough; "Intensity" is a key matching factor. | Use career/education data as a proxy for "Intensity" or "Mindset". |

## Summary of Themes

### 1. The Reliability Gap (Commitment)
*   **Definition**: Users stop trying because the "cost" of flaky interactions (wasted time/hope) outweighs the potential "reward" of a connection.
*   **Validation**: 4/6 interviewees mentioned "Canceling" or "Rescheduling" as a primary pain point.

### 2. The Trust Filter (Safety/Quality)
*   **Definition**: Before meeting, users need a "Signal" that the other person is "Safe" (physically) and "Normal" (socially).
*   **Validation**: "Stalking" behavior confirms users crave verification.

### 3. Relevance Signal (Homophily)
*   **Definition**: Users want to meet people "Like them" (Professional, Intense, Parent) but current apps only filter by generic tags (Movies, Hiking).
*   **Validation**: High-achievers specifically look for "peers" rather than just "people".
