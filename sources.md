## 1. Market Data ("The Loneliness Economy")
*   **Total Market Size**: The "Loneliness Economy" is estimated at **~$300 Billion** globally (2024), comprising mental health tech, co-living, and social connection services.
    *   *Source*: [Markets and Markets Analysis / Vertex AI Research Summary](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com) (General industry estimation).
    *   *Takeaway*: It's a massive, multi-sector opportunity, not just "apps".
*   **Social Discovery / Friendship Apps**:
    *   **Market Size**: ~$2.5 Billion (2024), projected to grow to $7.6B by 2031 (CAGR ~17%).
    *   *Source*: [Cognitive Market Research (2024)](https://www.cognitivemarketresearch.com/social-discovery-software-market-report)
    *   *Takeaway*: Distinct from the $9B Dating App market. "Friendship" is a smaller but faster-growing niche.
*   **Dating vs. Friending Disparity**:
    *   **Dating Apps**: ~$9 Billion global revenue (2024).
    *   **Friendship Apps**: Estimated ~$16 Million consumer spend (US, local-first apps).
    *   *Source*: [Forbes / Business of Apps 2024 estimates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/technology/2024/02/12/dating-apps-revenue-users-statistics/)
    *   *Takeaway*: There is a massive "Monetization Gap". People pay for romance, but haven't yet paid at scale for friendship.

## 2. Competitor Verification Mechanics
*   **Bumble BFF**:
    *   **Mechanism**: "Photo Verification" (User mimics a random pose to prove they are human/live). Optional "ID Verification" (upload Gov ID).
    *   *Limitation*: Verifies *Liveness* and *Identity*, but not *Intent* or *Personality Traits*. You know they are real, but not if they are "cool" or "reliable".
    *   *Source*: [Bumble Help Center - Verification](https://bumble.com/en/help/what-is-photo-verification)
*   **Meetup**:
    *   **Business Model**: Organizer Subscriptions + Ads.
    *   **Trust Issues**: High rate of "Ghost Towns" (inactive groups) and flakey RSVPs because anyone can join with just an email.
    *   *Source*: [Trustpilot Reviews / Reddit User Discussions (r/meetup)](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.meetup.com)
    *   *Takeaway*: Low barrier to entry = High noise/flake rate.

## 3. Academic Theory
*   **Signaling Theory (Economics/Biology)**:
    *   **Concept**: "Costly Signals". Signals that are expensive to produce (e.g., a Peacock's tail, a Harvard degree) are reliable indicators of fitness/quality because they are hard to fake.
    *   *Relevance*: Verifying hard-to-fake traits (Strava Marathon time, Career History) acts as a "Costly Signal" of trustworthiness and discipline.
    *   *Source*: Spence, A. M. (1973). *Job Market Signaling*. The Quarterly Journal of Economics.
*   **Homophily (Sociology)**:
    *   **Concept**: "Birds of a feather flock together". similarity breeds connection.
    *   *Relevance*: People prefer connecting with those who share verified attributes (Validation for "Match on Stats").
