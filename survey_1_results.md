# Survey 1 Results: Real Data Analysis

**Source**: User Survey CSV (`חברים וקשרים חדשים...`).
**N**: 45 Respondents.
**Demographics**: 20-40 age range, predominantly "Relocated/Transitioning".

## Key Findings

### Q: "When you want to do an activity (e.g., Tennis) and have no partner, what do you do?"
*   **"Go Alone" (Isolation)**: **44%** (Users are active but lonely).
*   **"Give Up" (Missed Opportunity)**: **22%** (Users lose life experiences due to lack of connection).
*   **"Look in Groups"**: 15% (High friction).
*   **"Don't do such activities"**: 19%.

### Q: "What makes you feel safe to meet?"
*   **"Profile looks true/detailed"**: Top factor.
*   **"Video Call / Phone Call"**: Second factor.
*   **"Mutual Friends"**: Third factor.

### Insight
The market failure isn't just "unmet people"—it's **Activity Isolation**. 
66% of users are either doing things alone or cancelling them because the "Cost of Coordination" is too high.
They rely on manual verification (Calls/Profile checks) to bridge the trust gap.
